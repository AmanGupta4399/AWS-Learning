Learn how to create AMI
Learn how to create instances by using AMI
Learn how to create templates and to use that templated for new instance
Learn how to create user in IAM 
Dashboards : In this we get overview that how many instances , key pairs , snapshots, volumes , load balancer etc are running in 
EC2 global view :
Region Explorer -In  this we can see that in which region how many instances are running which are owned by me , which help us to know about my instance and can save our money.
Region & Zones - in this we get region name with its code as well as geographic ares like (Asia, Europe , USA etc)
Availablity zone - in this we get zone name with its loaction and region
Events - in this we get notofications if any mishappening occurs in AWS like any region or zone is out or any other event 
instances are categised in several groups(General purpose ,Compute optimized, Memory optimized, storage optimized, HAC optimized)
Genral purpose - General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources generaaly starts with 
Compute optimized - for high processors
Memory optimized - for high performance with large memory
Storage optimised - They’re designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets
Templates - we create  one or more template to craete instances from that,  which already consists all information for that instance (means we dont enter details for our machine manually it takes that information from template )
AMI(Machine image) - backup of our instance will show here as well as we can create new instance by using AMI
AMI catlog - in this we can see AMI owned by me , community 
Elastic ips - when we start or stop ur machine its private ip always change so for not this we create elastic ips
EBS volume (elastic block store) every instance is connected with EBS volume which stores data , we  can extend ebs volume, it is network drive 
Availability zone for instance and EBS will same (we cant connect my EBS with another Instance of diff availablity zone)
One EBS can connect with one istance only at a time (but we can connect multiple EBS with single isntance)
Security group - in this we configure traffic of our  instance , we can add multiple security group to one instance
load balancer - to reduce server response time we use load balancer (by using this we hit load balancer directly instead of isntance)
load balancer uses round robin algorithm
4 types of load balancer(classic, appliacation, network, gateway) network works on transport layer , application works on appl.layer
